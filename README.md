# daily_python

This repo is dedicated to practicing and learning python. I will submit one post daily to practice python myself, using various online challenges from reddit, mathematical sites, and other machine learning techniques I want to try. Making these posts daily will help solidify my understanding of the programming language and allow me to be able to use python to the best of my ability.
